# backpackersPlanner
A backpacking planning site focused on enjoying the hike rather than completing the hike.

This is the open source project behind the site https://saunterquest.com

This is a work in progress, still early in development. It is currently being converted to use ReactJS on the client side and the PHP code is being replaced with nodejs.
